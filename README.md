So you start in a huge town (circa 1850s), following that old boring routine you have been used to for the past 15 years. You are on your way downstairs when you pick up the newspaper on your doorstep. The headline reads "GOLD FOUND ON WESTERN ISLAND. MASS MIGRATION WEST FOLLOWS". This is your oppurtunity to finally make it big. You go back into your house to grab whatever you can find. 15 bucks, not bad, and some food. You go downstairs to the market and buy some stuff using your money. You head downtown to the bridge leading west. Turns out they closed it down due to overflow of people. You decide to go to the docks and take a boat. After a long ride on the smelly boat, you arrive.
Once on the island, you see them turning people around to go back due to the large population. You sneak through their sewers and end up in. what you think is an abandoned gold mine. You continue forward, until a big man with a gruff voice catches you. He won't report you, but you will have to work for him until you get 5 gold ingots. He gives you a pick, and you teleport into a mine abundant with gold. You collect five gold and head out. He points you to a near mining town. (haven't gotten past here...)
Anyway, so then you can work for either a mining company, and have protection while mining, and a place to mine, but are severly underpaid, or take your chances on your own...
